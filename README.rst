Case Conductor vendor library
=============================

These are the pre-installed Python dependencies of the Case Conductor test
case manager.  The contents of this repository are generated using the
``bin/generate-vendor-lib`` script in the main Case Conductor repository at
https://github.com/mozilla/caseconductor-ui, and this repository is included
as a git submodule of that one.
