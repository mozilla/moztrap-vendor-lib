        django-icanhaz
        ==============
        
        A templatetag for easier integration of `ICanHaz.js`_ JavaScript templates with
        Django templates.
        
        .. _ICanHaz.js: http://icanhazjs.com
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Tested with `Django`_ 1.3 through trunk, and `Python`_ 2.6 and 2.7. Almost
        certainly works with older versions of both.

        .. _Python: http://www.python.org/
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from PyPI with ``pip``::
        
            pip install django-icanhaz
        
        or get the `in-development version`_::
        
            pip install django-icanhaz==dev
        
        .. _in-development version: https://github.com/carljm/django-icanhaz/tarball/master#egg=django_secure-dev
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        * Add ``"icanhaz"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        
        * Set the ``ICANHAZ_DIRS`` setting to a list of full (absolute) path to
          directories where you will store your ICanHaz templates.
        
        * ``{% load icanhaz %}`` and use ``{% icanhaz "templatename" %}`` in your
          Django templates to safely embed the ICanHaz.js template at
          ``<ICANHAZ_DIRS-entry>/templatename.html`` into your Django template,
          automatically wrapped in ``<script id="templatename" type="text/html">``,
          ready for ``ich.templatename({...})`` in your JavaScript.
        
        ``django-icanhaz`` does not bundle `ICanHaz.js`_ or provide any JavaScript
        utilities; it just helps you easily embed the templates in your HTML. Include
        `ICanHaz.js`_ in your project's static assets and use it in your JS as usual.
        
        
        Advanced usage
        --------------
        
        You can also bundle ICanHaz templates with Django reusable apps; by default
        ``django-icanhaz`` will look for templates in a ``jstemplates`` subdirectory of
        each app in ``INSTALLED_APPS``. The app subdirectory name(s) to check can be
        configured via the ``ICANHAZ_APP_DIRNAMES`` setting, which defaults to
        ``["jstemplates"]``.
        
        The finding of templates can be fully controlled via the ``ICANHAZ_FINDERS``
        setting, which is a list of dotted paths to finder classes. A finder class
        should be instantiable with no arguments, and have a ``find(name)`` method
        which returns the full absolute path to a template file, given a base-name.
        
        By default, ``ICANHAZ_FINDERS`` contains ``"icanhaz.finders.FilesystemFinder"``
        (which searches directories listed in ``ICANHAZ_DIRS``) and
        ``"icanhaz.finders.AppFinder"`` (which searches subdirectories named in
        ``ICANHAZ_APP_DIRNAMES`` of each app in ``INSTALLED_APPS``), in that order --
        thus templates found in ``ICANHAZ_DIRS`` take precedence over templates in
        apps.
        
        
        Rationale
        ---------
        
        The collision between Django templates' use of ``{{`` and ``}}`` as template
        variable markers and `ICanHaz.js`_' use of same has spawned a variety of
        solutions. `One solution`_ simply replaces ``[[`` and ``]]`` with ``{{`` and
        ``}}`` inside an ``icanhaz`` template tag; `another`_ makes a valiant attempt
        to reconstruct verbatim text within a chunk of a Django template after it has
        already been mangled by the Django template tokenizer.
        
        I prefer to keep my JavaScript templates in separate files in a dedicated
        directory anyway, to avoid confusion between server-side and client-side
        templating. So my contribution to the array of solutions is essentially just an
        "include" tag that avoids parsing the included file as a Django template (and
        for convenience, automatically wraps it in the script tag that `ICanHaz.js`_
        expects to find it in).
        
        Enjoy!
